I spent approximately 3 hours on this assignment. 
All aspects have been correctly implemented.

I moved the ship's code into its own file, ship.js, 
and modified it to work off of the prototype system rather than
as a set of functions. I did the same wth the enemy code. I then
added collision handling between the ship and enemies. After, I
added rock.js and its collison handling with the ship.
