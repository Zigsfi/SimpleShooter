Objects files, namely ship, enemy and rock, were refactored into their own files.
ship.js handles constructing object ship and mainly the controlling aspect of the player's ship.
enemy.js and rock.js handle the construction of object enemy and rock respectively, and the collision between ship and them.
The remainning lines in game.js are for game input and world construction.
