Title: SimpleShooter
Created by: Jacob Caccamo
Date: 9/29/15

The following changes have been made to SimpleShooter:

	Enemy and player (ship) code have been refactored into their own files, thus cleaning up the directory.

	A "Rock" group has been added to the game.

	Collisions are fully functional in the following ways:

		The player is detroyed on collision with any enemy.

		Rocks are destroyed on collision with the player.

The changes implemented above make SimpleShooter a richer and more interactive experience for players. Please consider implementing these changes into the source.
