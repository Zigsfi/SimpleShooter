Simple Shooter Lab

I separated the ship code into its own file and added it to the index.
I added another file for the enemy code and made enemy code as there was 
none. I added a collision handler so if the ship and enemy overlaps, the 
ship is destroyed. I then created a file for the rock code. Rocks are very
similar to enemies except they don't move and when the ship collides with
them the rock is destroyed not the ship.
