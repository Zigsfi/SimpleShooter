This is the ReadMe for the SimpleShooter lab.

This game features a ship sprite that avoids enemy sprites and rocks.
If the ship collides with an enemy the ship dies, if the ship collides 
with a rock, the rock dies upon collision. 

The ship, enemy, and rock each have their own files and are called in the
game file. The ship updates within its own file while the enemies update 
in game.js. This was done to show that individual elements can be updated
in both places.
