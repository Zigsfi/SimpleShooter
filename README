## Simple Shooter Refactorization      ##

This is a simple refactorization of the simple shooter base code. I pulled out the player and enemy
as seperate objects files with their own update functions. The player object update functions handles
the user input and controls while the enemy update functions includes the simple AI of following the 
player. 

The rocks group is included in the game.js files and it randomly placed around the play area. ALl
collision checks are done in game.js's update functions using .overlap funtions inside the arcade physics
suite.
